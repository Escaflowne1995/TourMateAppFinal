# Real-Time Updates Implementation

## Overview
The TourMate application now supports **automatic real-time updates** when the admin panel adds, edits, or deletes delicacies and destinations. Users will see changes instantly without needing to refresh the app.

## How It Works

### 1. Real-Time Subscriptions
- **Delicacies**: Subscribes to `local_delicacies` table changes
- **Destinations**: Subscribes to `destinations` table changes
- Uses Supabase's real-time PostgreSQL changes feature

### 2. Automatic Data Refresh
When changes are detected:
1. Cache is cleared to force fresh data
2. New data is fetched from Supabase
3. UI is automatically updated
4. Visual indicator shows update count

### 3. Visual Feedback
- Real-time indicator appears after first update
- Shows number of updates received
- Styled with primary color theme

## Technical Implementation

### Services Created
- `DelicaciesDataServiceSupabase.js` - Handles delicacies with real-time subscriptions
- `DestinationsDataServiceSupabase.js` - Handles destinations with real-time subscriptions
- Updated `AttractionsDataServiceSupabase.js` - Uses new destinations service

### Hook Updates
- `useHomeData.js` - Added real-time subscription management
- Automatically subscribes/unsubscribes on component mount/unmount
- Handles real-time update callbacks

### UI Updates
- `HomeScreen.js` - Added real-time update indicator
- Shows update count and live status

## Testing Real-Time Updates

### Steps to Test:
1. **Open the user application** (React Native app)
2. **Open the admin panel** in a web browser
3. **Add a new delicacy** in the admin panel:
   - Click "+ Add Delicacy"
   - Fill in the form (name, origin, description)
   - Click "Add Item"
4. **Watch the user app** - it should automatically show the new delicacy
5. **Add a new destination** in the admin panel
6. **Watch the user app** - it should automatically show the new destination

### Expected Behavior:
- âœ… New items appear instantly in the user app
- âœ… Real-time indicator shows update count
- âœ… No manual refresh needed
- âœ… Works for both delicacies and destinations

## Console Logs
When real-time updates occur, you'll see logs like:
```
ðŸ”„ Setting up real-time subscriptions...
ðŸ“¡ Destinations real-time update: INSERT
ðŸ”„ Refreshing destinations data due to real-time update...
âœ… Destinations data refreshed from real-time update
```

## Benefits
- **Instant Updates**: Changes appear immediately
- **Better UX**: No need to manually refresh
- **Real-Time Sync**: Admin and user apps stay in sync
- **Visual Feedback**: Users know when updates occur
- **Efficient**: Only refreshes when changes happen

## Requirements
- Supabase project with real-time enabled
- Proper RLS policies for table access
- Network connection for real-time subscriptions
